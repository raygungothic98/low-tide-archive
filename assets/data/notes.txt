The river remembers what it carries.  
Every sound is a stone in the mouth.  
Low tide reveals what the current forgot.  
Silt gathers like thoughts.  
The moon pulls on what we bury.  
Driftwood keeps its own calendar.  
Estuary—where one body meets another.  
The tide writes and erases in the same gesture.  
Brackish sleep between the fresh and the salt.  
An archive written in mud and moonlight.  
The eelgrass sways toward the memory of light.  
The river’s mouth never closes completely.  
We measure time by the return of herons.  
Even silence moves.  
Tides are just breath made planetary.  
The silt hums when the wind passes over it.  
Listening is another form of remembering.  
Each fragment drifts until it finds a home.  
Nothing is lost; it just learns to flow differently.  
Some archives dissolve on purpose.  
Sediment is language with its vowels softened.  
The river keeps speaking, even when we don’t.  
Between stillness and storm—this is the true rhythm.  
Every confluence is a conversation.  
We belong to the tide that forgets us.  
The sound of low tide is a form of handwriting.
