The river remembers what it carries… every sound is a stone in the mouth.
Low tide reveals what the current forgot, silt gathers like thoughts.
The eelgrass writes in cursive beneath the waves… brine breathes through copper and bone.
What is buried learns to listen, the tide hums a language older than salt.

Fish move like unfinished sentences, the mud dreams in the shape of our absence.
A single ripple can remember a century… every estuary is a mouth learning to speak again.
Driftwood keeps the pulse of vanished storms, time pools where the light bends shallow.
We are sediment rearranged by longing… each fragment an echo of the last flood.

Silence erodes slower than granite, the river writes its autobiography in frequencies.
To record the tide is to forget linear time… everything alive is busy becoming water.
In the reeds, memory sifts itself back into sound…
The delta exhales a century at a time.

There is a place where fresh water tastes like return.
Every frequency a story, every shimmer a syllable.
The low tide pulls the sky down for a moment,
and in that pause, the whole river dreams.
